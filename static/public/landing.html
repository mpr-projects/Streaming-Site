    <p>
        This page is a demonstration which uses flask as a backend, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front end.
        The code and all data is saved in AWS S3 buckets. The website uses AWS's Elastic Beanstalk, and all data is
        uploaded via the command line utility `eb deploy` (and various other `eb` commands were used for debugging).
        The page was created and set up on AWS in approximately 1.5 days. I used an LLM as a helper but they are not
        very good in more complicated setups so my own code-understanding was crucial to get it setup so quickly (most
        time was spent on setting up AWS users, roles and permissions).
        Note, currently the page is NOT encrypted (it's not using https because I haven't linked it to a domain name),
        this will be added later. All code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/mpr-projects/Streaming-Site" target="_blank">github</a>.

        <summary><h3>General Design</h3></summary>
            I use a single page setup. The index.html page is always shown and it contains a navigation bar
            on top and a content section beneath it. The content of the navigation bar is populated in
            JavaScript and depends on whether the user is logged in or not. The current page is saved
            in the window.location.hash attribute. A link changes that attribute and a listener on
            it loads the appropriate page into the content section. The video page uses flexbox for alignment.

        <summary><h3>Security</h3></summary>
        One objective of this test-website is to create a public section and a protected
        section. A user should only be able to access the protected section after they've
        registered and logged in. To prevent unauthorized access to the protected section
        we use HttpOnly cookies and the 'double-submit' cookie pattern. It works as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                HttpOnly cookies cannot be read by client scripts. So users can't access or
                edit them (even with code injections). However, our backend can set them to
                indicate that a user is logged in. When a page is loaded then the backend
                checks if the cookie exists. If it doesn't exist then the user is redirected
                to the login page. The cookie is deleted when a user logs out. Since users
                can't access this cookie, they can't pretend to be logged in (preventing
                Cross-Site Scripting attacks). This cookie is set automatically by Flask's 
                LoginManager.
            </li>
            <li>
                The HttpOnly cookie by itself doesn't fully protect the website. If
                a user is logged in and opens another website, then that other website could send
                requests to our website. Since the user is logged in, the HttpOnly cookie exists
                so the request will be executed. To ensure that only requests from our own
                website are executed the backend adds a random string (the CSRF token) as a
                cookie. This cookie can be read by JavaScript. Any request to our backend must
                then include the value of this cookie, ie the CSRF token. A request is only
                processed by the backend if the CSRF token received matches the one that was set
                before. The CSRF token is changed after every request for added security. This
                prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <summary><h3>Video Streaming</h3></summary>
        Videos are uploaded to the S3 bucket with a local upload script. For each video three files
        can be uploaded: the video file, a thumbnail and a text file containing the label of the video.
        The 'Video' page (which can only be seen when you're logged in) loads the contents of the S3
        bucket, processes them and returns them to JavaScript. JavaScript then creates the HTML code
        and populates the appropriate part of the 'Video' HTML page.

        <summary><h3>Potential Improvements</h3></summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Link to domain for https encryption</li>
            <li>E-Mail confirmation: Right now there is no confirmation to check if the email address provided by the user is valid.</li>
            <li>DRM protection: Adding DRM protection to the videos would be nice to prevent them from being downloaded easily.</li>
            <li>A nicer layout.</li>
        </ul>
